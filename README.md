# Worqd (College Project)
This is an android application that developed using Android Studio as the IDE. 
Worqd is a similar application to Fiver that developed to support Freelancer and their seeker so both of them can meet each other. 
The application itself is using SQLite as the local DB and fully written with Kotlin.
Worqd still need a huge continuous development because it still use local DB and the app itself is not done yet
which means there are so many features that aren't developed yet.
